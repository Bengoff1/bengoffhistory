# Plan for the Rest of the Semester
The last two weeks have been difficult from a conceptual point of view. I have been trying to determine how this website and computational methods in general can best serve my career, whether inside or outside academia. If I stay inside academia, I want to make sure that computational methods do real work, and are not just window dressings layered on top of a close reading of primary sources. Ideally, computational methods and close reading should work together, as we have observed in Underwood and other readings. The work I have done to this point in the class, especailly with the hospital statistics from 1803, is suitable for producing visaulizations. However, I worry that I do not have enough data from other periods and that further work with the material will be oif limited value for my dissertation. Because my dissetation runs from 1630 to 1815, I would feel more comfortable if I had statistics from a variety of periods and not just the Napoleonic Wars. I do not want to include visualizations simply for visualization's sake. I plan on going on a second research trip to France where I hope to find more documents like the statistics from 1803 but I cannot be sure that such documents exist. In other words, I think another research trip France is necessary to know if the route I have been following this semester is viable in the long term. 

To deal with this issue, I will spend the rest of the semester with an eye towards the non-academic job market by improving my skills in several areas and using the website as a way to demonstrate those skills. I hope to do five things to my website, There are only three week left in the semester, So I should aim to complete about 1.5 things to the website per week. 

1. **Beautify the Website:** Here, I hope to alter how the posts are laid out and change the tabs at the top of the page to allow for easier navigation. Most importanty, I want to be able to post usuable images on the site. As of now, I can post images but they are too small to be viewable.   
2. **Produce a  range of complex visualizations using R and Tableau:** I have spent too much time with the hospital statisitics to discard them completely. Instead I will try to produce a map of hospital locations via tableau, and a variety of graphs using R. 
3. **Become a better text cleaner:** I feel that my primary document of 1803 hospital statistics was an easy document to clean. I want to improve my skills in this area by cleaning several miltiary medical journals, documenting the process, and publishing the results to the website. 
4. **Produce tabular data from cleaned texts:** Here I want to take the next step and make sure that I can use the cleaned journals to produce CSV or TSV files. 
5. **Produce a visualization from the journals:** Lastly, I want to complete the process of working with the military medical journals by producing at least a simple vizualisation. 

# Future Plans 
I hope to keep computational methods in my pocket as a tool going forward. I would like to find a way to make useful for my dissertation, but I have not found it this semester. After my second research trip, I will have a better idea of what types of computational methods I can use in the dissertation. As of now, I might be able to do a prosopography or network analysis of military medical practitioners. This would be a later chapter in the dissertation, and I was not yet ready to tackle it this semester. Also, many of the documents that speak to this issue are handwritten and not easily OCR'd.
