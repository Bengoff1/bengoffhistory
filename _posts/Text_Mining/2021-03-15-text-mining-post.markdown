# Texts 
**Reference:** I selected military medical journals published in the mid to late 18th century to serve as my reference body of texts. The first of these jounrals,*Journal de medecine militaire* first published in 1781, was the brainchild of Jacques de Horne, a miltiary doctor who also served as physician to members of the royal family. The second journal published in 1766 and entitled *Recueil d'observations de médecine des hôpitaux militaires* was edited by Richard de Hauterierck, who served as the head doctor for French armies. 

**Primary:** For my primary texts, from these journals I selected individual artcles on medical topography. Medical topography was an in-vogue topic for early modern medical practitioners. At the time, Hippocrates' theories about the environment's impact on human health dictated that doctors and surgeons intimately understand the local climates in which they worked. They also needed to know how things like water quality, elevation change, seasonal shifts, soil quality and local foods could make people sick or keep them healthy. Producing articles on medical topography was a great way for the military to keep track of the local climates in which particualr hopsitals were located.
