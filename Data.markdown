## Data concerning French military medicine (1630-1815)

My dissertation examines the French military-medical system in the early modern period. I pay close attention to how that system was financed and administered. Furthermore, I am interested in how finances and administration influenced healing outcomes for soldiers. This page serves two purposes. First, it is linked to a GitHub repository containing various files relating to military medicine for public consumption. Second, it serves as a data map that describes the documents in the repository detailing things like the documents' provinence, its date of creation, its contents, and any relevant context. Please feel free to use these files if they will help with your own research. 

Finally, this page will be updated and changed as my research progresses. This is an on-going project, and while the dissertation itself will reach a definitive state of completion, this site and the data on it will continue to evlove and gorw. It will probably never reach a state of completion. Please be patient with any errors or dirty text you may find.

## Data Map

#### Structure of the repository 
When you click the above link, you will see the homepage of the repository. Currently, There are two folders, one with archival documents entitled "Hospital Statistics" and one with published primary sources entitled "journals".  

In the first folder are CSV and TSV files (containing tables) produced from archival documents held at the French war archives at Vincennes. More detailed information for these found on the Readme.md file in the folder itself, but information found here includes number of patients, number of patients healed, number of patients deceased etc... This data set is incomplete and will be updated periodically.

In the second folder are military medical journals. The military supported two medical jounrals in the 18th century. The first was edited by Hauterierck, entitled _Recueil d'observations de médecine des hôpitaux militaires_ and ran between 1766 and 1767. The second was edited by Dehorne, entitled _Journal de médecine militaire_ and was published between 1781 and 1788.
